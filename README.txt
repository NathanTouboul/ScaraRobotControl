Instructions for use :

- Launch the visualization_trame.m script for the first time to create the variables in the workspace
(You might  have errors at the end of the program because the simulation files are not yet created)
- Make run section of question 12
- Open the Simulink model and launch the simulation and visualize the results of question 12  in the scope
- Make run section of question 14
- Then, run section of question 15, open the Simulink qu15 model and run the simulation
- Run section question 15b to visualize the trajectory in a circle
- Change the value of mc and run section question 16
- Return to the main Simulink and launch the simulation to perform the calculation with mc different from 0
- Run section question 16b to visualize trajectories with the addition of mass
- Run question section 17 to visualize the effect of disturbances
